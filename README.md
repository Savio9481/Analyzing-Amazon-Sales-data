Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my project on Amazon sales data analysis! As part of my internship with Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd, I had the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into analyzing sales data.

In this project, I used Python to analyze Amazon sales data and created visualizations to better understand trends and patterns. I also used machine learning algorithms to make predictions about future sales.

I had a great time working on this project and learned a lot in the process. I hope it inspires you to dive into data analysis and explore the insights that can be gained from it.![Screenshot 2024-05-21 195856](https://github.com/Savio9481/Analyzing-Amazon-Sales-data/assets/148083814/99d6ff03-aca5-4bc5-b202-4ac73dee7796)
